Write a separate program to accomplish this exercise.
Save the program with a filename alien_colors3.py.

Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 4 into an if-elif-else
chain.

If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points. 
If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.

Write three versions of this program, making sure each
message is printed for the appropriate color alien.

#Version 1

alien_color = "green"

if (alien_color == "green"):
    print("You earned 5 points.")
elif (alien_color == "yellow"):
    print("You earned 10 points.")
elif (alien_color == "red"):
    print("You earned 15 points")
    
#Version 2

if (alien_color == "green"):
    print("You earned 5 points.")
elif (alien_color == "yellow"):
    print("You earned 10 points.")
