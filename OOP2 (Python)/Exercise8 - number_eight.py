Write a separate program to accomplish this exercise.
Save the program with a filename number_eight.py.

Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations that each result in the number 8.
Be sure to enclose your operations in print() calls to see the
results. You should create four lines that look like this:
    
    print(5+3)
    print(?-?)
    
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8
appearing once on each line.
