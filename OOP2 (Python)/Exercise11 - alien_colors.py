Write a separate program to accomplish this exercise.
Save the program with a filename alien_colors.py.

Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green',
'yellow', or 'red'.

Write a simple-if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color
is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5
points.

Write one version of this program that passes the if test and
another that fails. (The version that fails will have no
output.)

alien_color = "green"

if (alien_color == "green"):
    print("You earned 5 points")
