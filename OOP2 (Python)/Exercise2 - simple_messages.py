Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. Save each program with a filename
that follows standard Python conventions, using lowercase letters and underscores, such as
simple_message.py and simple_messages.py

1. Simple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then
print that message.

2. Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable and print
that message. Then change the value of the variable to a
new message and print the new message.
'''

message = "Hola Amigos !"

print(message)

message = "Hello Everyone !"

print(message)
